A basic reflector agent in LangGraph is an agent that simply returns the input it receives without any modifications. It acts like an echo, reflecting back the same data.  

Key Features:  
- No Processing: It does not alter, analyze, or generate new information.  
- Useful for Debugging: Helps test workflows by verifying data flow.  
- Placeholder in Workflows: Can be used as a temporary step before implementing more complex logic.  

This type of agent is often used in early-stage development to ensure that data is being passed correctly through a LangGraph pipeline.
